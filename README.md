## Inspiration
Our goal is to fix the universityâ€™s class registration system in order to make registering easier for students.
## What it does
By removing unnecessary features of the XE Registration System, it will allow users to interact with the system more easily and simplified enough to not cause issues.
## How we built it
We remodeled the website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We did this by redesigning three pages, Select a Term, Register for classes and Schedule page. The changes we made autofill the semester being registered for in the first page and remove the Schedule and Summary. The changes made in the second page remove the Schedule and Summary into a tab open menu at the bottom. To avoid unnecessary clicks, we placed all classes of a particular subject on one page using limitless scrolling and closed drop down for discussions. We changed the placement of the Discussion and Lecture sections by indenting the linked discussions for their respective lectures that allows drop down.
## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we have run through was how we can add the backend with the front using JavaScript, difficulties in using git and merging code properly, and syntax regarding JavaScript. One of the biggest issues we encountered was pushing and committing the code using GitHub when the backend didn't work properly.  
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how far we have gotten on this project. We did estimate the level of work required to complete this but we did pull this off. One nitty gritty detail is that we are proud of the smaller buttons working on the page. 
## What we learned
Everyone learned some HTML and CSS and one of our team members is proud of learning JavaScript on the fly.
## What's next for ZenCoders
For ZenCoders, each of us has found a team that was fun to collaborate and work with. If it's possible we may team together again in the future.
